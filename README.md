Messing around with hyper
=============================================

This is me messing around with code from *Hands-On Microservices With Rust* to explore Rust further, and the [hyper](http://hyper.rs) crate.

You'd probably be better off looking at *Hands-On Microservices With Rust* unless you really like half-baked comments mixed in with your code.
